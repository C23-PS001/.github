Description :

Indonesia as a democratic country has 275 million people and there will be approximately 200 million voters in the next 2024 election. According to national election data from 2004 to 2019, more than 20% of voters chose to abstain for several reasons including the necessity to vote in a specific polling station which sometimes burdens the voters. Therefore we want to improve user experience by creating a flexible mobile election system that can be accessed anywhere. To ensure the election principle stays protected even though the election is in the form of online, facial recognition is used in order to maintain integrity. These systems allow voters to vote anywhere even if they are not in their hometown and even if they are abroad. At the same time, this system also increases the accuracy and efficiency. 

This github organization contains four repositories for each learning path but we made 2 repositories for machine learning because we deployed two different APIs for machine learning models
